## Main idea

Idea is to learn more about image detection. In this experiment I create example for learn and train the two type of models for image detection (SSD and Faster R-CNN).

## System architecture

In this experiment I used following technologies:
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

We train and validate two models:
- SSD (Single-Shot Detector)
- Faster R-CNN

## Installation and running

So you need first to clone this repo.

You can locally run app with Jupyter Notebooks or you should use Google Colab.
